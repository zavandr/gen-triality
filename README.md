# On generation by triality automorphisms 
[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) code accompanying a paper with the same title
by Danila O. Revin and Andrei V. Zavarnitsine.

The code is in [this file](code.gap).

---

We also make available in [this file](Generators_O8(2)S3.txt) generators  <i>x, y, r, s</i>  for the extension O<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>(2)&thinsp;:&thinsp;S<sub>3</sub> 

as explicit  24 x 24 - matrices over the field F<sub>2</sub> with two elements given in GAP's format, 

where S<sub>3</sub> = < <i>r, s</i> > is a group of graph (triality) automorphisms of O<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>(2) = < <i>x, y</i> > with |<i>r</i>| = 3, and |<i>s</i>| = 2.

The notation O<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>(2) follows that of the [ATLAS of Finite Groups ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATLAS_of_Finite_Groups)
and means 

the projective simple orthogonal group PÎ©<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>(2) of order 174182400.
