# On generation by triality automorphisms 
[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) code accompanying a paper 
by Danila O. Revin and Andrei V. Zavarnitsine

The code is in the file [code.gap](code.gap) 

---

We also post in [Generators_O8(2)S3.txt](Generators_O8(2)S3.txt)  explicit generators  <i>x, y, r, s</i>  

for the extension O<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>(2)&thinsp;:&thinsp;S<sub>3</sub> as 24 x 24 - matrices over the field F<sub>2</sub> with two elements, 

where S<sub>3</sub> = < <i>r, s</i> > is a group of graph (triality) automorphisms of O<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>(2) = < <i>x, y</i> >,

|<i>r</i>| = 3, and |<i>s</i>| = 2.
